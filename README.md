<h1 align="center">Child-Adult-Care-Food-Program</h1>
The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a federal program that provides reimbursements for nutritious meals and snacks to eligible children and adults who are enrolled for care at participating childcare centers, daycare homes, and adult daycare centers. We will be applying different data mining techniques to the data set provided and mine the data and determine which characteristics are useful to determine the reimbursement amount received and meal participation rates.

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
The first stage in our study was to make sure the dataset was of good quality. To ensure the dataset's quality for our study, we first explored the data to understand its columns and content. The dataset consisted of 65 columns and 1558 rows, containing both numerical and categorical data. We identified missing values in the dataset that were related to child participation and numerical in nature. Based on the documentation from the reference site, we replaced the missing values with 0 to ensure the data's consistency and accuracy.
