# Child-Adult-Care-Food-Program
The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a federal program that provides reimbursements for nutritious meals and snacks to eligible children and adults who are enrolled for care at participating childcare centers, daycare homes, and adult daycare centers. We will be applying different data mining techniques to the data set provided and mine the data and determine which characteristics are useful to determine the reimbursement amount received and meal participation rates.
